# Distributed Generation Data Loader

## 🧾 Summary

This project automates the processing and insertion of Distributed Generation (GD) datasets provided by ANEEL (Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency) into an Oracle database. It processes structured data on energy generation plants, subsidies, tariffs, capacity factors, and irradiation indexes, enabling structured, query-ready storage for business intelligence and regulatory applications.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository consolidates data pipelines that handle various aspects of Brazil’s distributed energy generation ecosystem. The datasets are sourced from ANEEL and are pre-processed using Python scripts, then loaded into Oracle tables using SQL inserts and batch operations.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 1. **Python Scripts for Data Ingestion**
Each script processes a specific type of GD dataset:

- `GD_Aplicacao_20230518.py`: Processes the application forms of distributed generation units.
- `GD_empreedimentos_ANEEL_20230801.py`: Processes data about energy generation projects registered with ANEEL.
- `GD_samp_ANEEL_20230817.py`: Loads consolidated statistical data of GD units.
- `GD_samp_balanco_ANEEL_20230807.py`: Handles energy balance data from ANEEL reports.
- `GD_subsidios_ANEEL_20230620.py`: Loads data on public subsidies granted to GD projects.
- `GD_tarifas_ANEEL_20230620.py`: Ingests updated tariff data per distribution concession.
- `GD_UCsPorMunicipio_20230720.py`: Loads data about consumer units (UCs) per municipality.

Each script follows a standard structure:
- Download/parse .CSV or Excel files from ANEEL sources
- Clean and transform data (drop missing fields, type conversion, normalization)
- Connect to Oracle database using `cx_Oracle`
- Batch insert into staging or final tables

### 2. **Static SQL Scripts**

#### `GD_FATOR_IRRADIACAO.sql`
Contains hardcoded irradiation indices per electricity distributor. These values are static and do not require periodic update scripts.

#### `GD_Fator_Capacidade.sql`
Stores capacity factor values by energy source type (e.g., solar, wind, thermal). These are constants used in performance estimates and do not require automation.

---

### 3. **Database Schema**

SQL scripts include:
- `Tabela_Oracle.sql`: Table creation statements and structure definitions for storing the processed datasets. Ensures the data model aligns with ANEEL’s regulatory reporting.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Ensure Python and Oracle client libraries are installed.
2. Configure Oracle connection credentials.
3. Run individual Python scripts for each dataset:
   ```bash
   python GD_samp_ANEEL_20230817.py
   ```
4. Run SQL scripts for static tables via Oracle SQL Developer or CLI:
   ```sql
   @GD_FATOR_IRRADIACAO.sql
   ```
